Reinhold with the purpose to create safer passwords than the alpha-numerics but still easy to remember.\r\nHow does it work?\r\n\r\nThe method is about rolling a dice five times (or just roll five dices) and taking notes of each result so that later you can query a list for the matching word. Just roll the dice as many times as you want to get the desired length. Here's an example:\r\n\r\nSupose we need a password with 2 words. Rolling the dice for the first time, we get the combination '52114' and on the second roll we get '25516'. Querying our list, we can see that '52114' matches the word 'ring' and '25516' matches 'fire'. So our password will be 'ringfire'.\r\n\r\nI know it might look like a lot of work. That's why Roll a Pass generates the passwords for you. And if the password is too hard to remember, you can store it on the app.\r\nWhere are the passwords stored?\r\n\r\nFor safety reasons, the app saves all of your passwords on your mobile device. In order to prevent data leaks, Roll a Pass has no acess to the Internet or any other network. If you want to store your passwords anywhere else, you can export them to a .txt file stored on your memory card (please delete this file after you copy it to a removable device or upload it to the cloud).\r\n\r\nYou can discover more features by downloading the app to your device. Just click on the yellow Rounded button on the corner. When you run the app for the first time, it might take up to 5min to setup, so please be patient.\r\n\r\nPlease report any bug.
